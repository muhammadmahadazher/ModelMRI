# Working log

## 2026-07-08 — Week 1, day 1
- Backend v0.1 skeleton LIVE: `modelmri serve` → FastAPI on :5900.
- `ModelRuntime`: loads any HF causal LM (default Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, 494M params), streams generation via `TextIteratorStreamer` in a worker thread.
- REST: `/api/session`, `/api/model/load`, `/api/model/prompt`. WS: `/ws/generate` (verified: 41 pieces streamed end-to-end).
- Built-in dark playground page at `/` (temporary until React frontend).
- Bug found by smoke test: Windows cp1252 console can't print `→` — crashed the CLI banner. Fixed to ASCII. (Good Day-2 post material.)
- Note: PyPI torch on Windows is CPU-only; 0.5B is snappy anyway (full generation in 2.5s). GPU via cu124 index or WSL2 when needed.
- Next: PyTorch forward hooks on attention layers → stream weights → WebGL arcs.

## 2026-07-08 — Week 0
- Name decided: **ModelMRI** ("an MRI machine for AI models"). Verified free on PyPI + npm.
- Repo created, skeleton committed: README with public roadmap, MIT license, CI (ruff + pytest + frontend build), Python package stub, npm stub.
- Dev environment confirmed: Python 3.12, uv, node 26, WSL2, RTX 4060.
- Next: publish name-reserving stubs to PyPI + npm, Substack setup, essay #1, Day-1 X post.
